This project contains a `user.js` file with security and privacy settings for the [Librewolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/) web browser. The `user.js` file is a configuration file that can be used to customize various aspects of the browser's behavior.

## Installation

To use these settings, follow these steps:
